# Hypercomplex Space

**Maintainer: Interval**

<tldr>
Hypercomplex space is represented with (i, j, k), and is the 3D full extension of the [complex plane]().
I call it theoretical because something like this rarely exists.

Essentially, a lot of movement is messed up, rotation and straight movement are swapped, and very few people can activate it in a battle.
If you like math, then read if you dare. But I'm not holding back.
