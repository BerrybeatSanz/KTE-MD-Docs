# Hypercomplex Space

**Maintainer: Interval**

<tldr>
Hypercomplex space is represented with (i, j, k), and is the 3D full extension of the complex plane.
I call it theoretical because something like this rarely exists.

Essentially, a lot of movement is messed up, rotation and straight movement are swapped, and very few people can activate it in a battle.
If you like math, then read if you dare. But I'm not holding back.

## Author's Note

Use this however you please, just get it right.
I don't want to have to correct people, I really don't.

## Coordinate Systems

When talking about dimensions, we're usually talking about the main topic of [dimension theory](DimT.md).
However, Spatial dimensions still exist, and I'm here to give you the full extent.

### Cartesian

Any regular spatial dimension will have that many numbers in the set that determines where a point is.
Each point is an element of the set of all real numbers, which is literally anything except any number that is / paired with the [imaginary unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit).

* 2D is two, usually `(x, y)`.
* 3D is three, usually `(x, y, z)`.
* 4D is four, usually `(x, y, z, w)`, but nobody can agree on the fourth letter. `w` is the most common.

### Complex Plane

The complex plane is the extension of these coordinate systems.
The dimensionality (quantity of dimensions) that a complex system has depends on how you think about it, but usually it's notated as 1D for a (x, y) [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane).
In this case, that's with respect to ("wrt") the set of all complex numbers. If it would be 2D, that's wrt to all real numbers.

Complex numbers are of the form `z = x + yi`, and can be used in complex analysis.
