# Hypercomplex Space

**Maintainer: Interval**

<tldr>
Hypercomplex space is represented with (i, j, k), and is the 3D full extension of the [complex plane]().
I call it theoretical because something like this rarely exists.

Essentially, a lot of movement is messed up, rotation and straight movement are swapped, and very few people can activate it in a battle.
If you like math, then read if you dare. But I'm not holding back.

## Author's Note

Use this however you please, just get it right.
I don't want to have to correct people, I really don't.

## Coordinate Systems

When talking about dimensions, we're usually talking about the main topic of [dimension theory](DimT.md).
However, Spatial dimensions still exist, and I'm here to give you the full extent.

### Cartesian

Any regular spatial dimension will have that many numbers in the set that determines where a point is.
Each point is an element of the set of all real numbers, which is literally anything except any number that is / paired with the [imaginary constant]().

* 2D is two, usually `(x, y)`.
* 3D is three, usually `(x, y, z)`.
* 4D is four, usually `(x, y, z, w)`, but nobody can agree on the fourth letter. `w` is the most common.

### Complex Plane

The complex plane is the extension of these coordinate systems.
Note that most regular planes have a single extension, but is still only considered the dimension that's the number of its real components.

* A 1D complex plane is `(x, yi)`, but it's still one dimension.
* 2D is `(x, y, zi)`.
* 3D is `(x, y, z, wi)`.
* Continue from there.

i'll finish this later
