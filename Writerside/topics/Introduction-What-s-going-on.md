# Introduction: What's going on?

This section covers quite a few things, but I might as well lay out the concept of the server right here and now.

## What does KTE stand for?

There's been 3 eras to KTE, 3 main ones at least.
Since this has been around for 6-ish years by technicality, it's an interesting case.

The phrase "KTE" represents all 3 eras, the first letter of each put in a double acronym.

### Kingdom

Kingdom is the K portion.
This is not currently a part of the server; it's been finished since late 2020.
Existing in the concept's earliest form, the name wasn't my own.
Soon enough, the story revolving around it will be created, but that isn't a high priority.

### TFCT

TFCT stands for Tangled Fabric of a Chaotic Timeline, which is a very good way to describe what it is.
It's a high-scaled combat-heavier set, still going on right now.
It's had a decently rich history, having ran on for a few years now, and counting.

### EOT

EOT stands for Elements Of Tranquility, which was an attempt to make a much lower stakes RP scene.
This has since been integrated as a separate space for those who don't want to potentially have more stressful situations,
or want to design ocs but not have to worry about them needing to be strong.

## What is the RP?

Anything.

This is dead serious; the RP is based on extremely free-form interactions between OCs.
Forcing interactions is frowned upon, and most ideas can stray somewhat from their original goal, since the effects that characters have can just as easily throw a wrench into things.
This adds complexity and customizability; rigidity and OCs don't go together.

## What do I need to do to begin?

There's a little more to this one.

It's advisable to submit an OCs in the OCs forum, and then you need to think.
When you get to Modern Dimension Theory, you'll understand quite how to introduce them.
Most often, people use portals.
Some fall through rifts.
But there's going to need to be some *explanation* as to why the OC is there, it doesn't have to be long.

Much more of this will be explained on the future articles, but that's just the synopsis.
