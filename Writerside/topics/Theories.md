# Theories

<tldr>
this is what i'm talking about below here
</tldr>

"Theories" is the category that anyt sort of conceptual framework is under.
A lot of these are complicated, and as such all include a `<tldr>` section, which is always at the top.
It's the rounded rectangle, like on this page.

If you need more in-depth information, that's what the rest of the page is for. Have fun reading all of it.
