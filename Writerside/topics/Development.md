# How do I contribute?

It takes a little effort to get started, but once you do, it's fairly easy to make changes to the site.
Do note that you still need to be a little technically inclined to do this; if you don't want to put in the time, I don't judge.
This is a weird process either way, meant for security / because nothing else works.

## Part 0: Terminology

This is very important to know, as a lot of these words will be used throughout the page.

Repository
: A place where code is put.
One can be created at any time, for any purpose, for free.

Git
: A source control framework.
Usually used for updating repositories, and is the backend of GitHub.

GitHub (GH)
: Frontend for Git & Repositories.

Github Pages
: A way to host free sites on GitHub. It's what we're using right now.

Branch
: A repository usually has one, two, or any amount of Branches.
Each one stores different code, but all must have some similar base to be useful.
Can be used for testing versions, higher major releases, etc.

Commit
: A change to a branch, whether local or online.

Push
: Push a change to a remote branch.
For example, you commit to a local clone of a repository, then push that commit to the origin so everyone else now has it.

Fetch
: Looks at what commits have been made and compares it to your local clone.

Pull
: Amends all changes from the target branch to your local clone.

Fork
: A fork is someone's own repository, pulled from another.
It's under the working of the forker, not the original maintainer.
Can be used for Pull Requests

Pull Request
: A request to merge a branch / fork back into the main repository.
Must be reviewed by the original maintainers and slowly worked through until it all is fine, and then merging is available.
Pull Requests can only be merged if the target and higher branch have commonalities and no conflicts.

Conflicts
: Problems with the merging process that would result in weird files are relayed to the maintainer before merging is available.
Must be fixed if at all possible.

Merging
: Commits from the higher fork / branch are made to the target branch.
