*Maintainer: Various*

## About

A hybrid isn't its own species.
Instead, it is a combination of two or more, that function in tandem to produce a result of which is fairly unique.
However, combinations (unless given a special term), are not dedicated species in their own right and fall under a Hybrid status.

## Usage

How exactly to use hybrids varies, as there's no wrong way to do it.
