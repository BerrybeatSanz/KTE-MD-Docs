# Dimensions

Dimensions are the server's main areas, and it's understandable that the definition isn't clear cut.
Some systems assume the term "Dimension" to mean an alternate reality; not quite good enough for this.

## Modern Dimension Theory

Dimensions since the whole KTE server began have become much less concrete.
However, they still exist, and have a formal definition.

### Dimensions

Dimension
: An area in space such that it is reasonably different at its core from other dimensions.
: Given a unique ID number.

Dimensions may fundamentally change how the physics work, the concepts used, what creatures are common, all sorts of things.

### Alternate Universes

For those familiar with the MCU or Undertale, they use Alternate Universes as opposed to Dimensions in this case.
These are referred to as AUs.

Alternate Universe (AU)
: A separate version of a dimension saddled on the 4th spacial dimensional axis (coordinate $w$),
such that the core elements are the same but the AU is still distinct enough to warrant its own AUID.

### Multiverse, Omniverse, Hyperverse, and Higher Orders {collapsible=true}

These things are going to be one after another, since they don't deserve their own section on their own.

Multiverse
: The set of all dimensions and its respective AUs.

Omniverse
: TFCT or EOT.

Hyperverse
: Contains Omniverses. There is 1 so far:
* Hyperverse 0 (H0) - Where all normal RP takes place.
: More may be added in the future.

Higher Orders are a general term for things that contain Hyperverses.
They need not be defined; we don't use them, but I'm acknowledging them here.

## Notation

Each dimension is explicitly stated as "Dimension $N$", where $N$ is the dimension's ID.
AUIDs are represented by "Dimension $N$-$A$", $A$ is the AUID.
