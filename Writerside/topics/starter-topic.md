## About

KTE is, as you may have heard, a sort of open-ended RP server.

The entire thing behind it, is that you can do whatever you want, within reason of course.

Combat, hanging out, anything you can think of, you can make happen.

We do have rules in place, but that's alright. Just follow them, we don't ask much.

By the way, all of this is done with Markdown, Jetbrains Writerside, Github Pages, and hope.

## Some guiding information

Species information is under foundations.

OC information is under their owner's page, if it's here. If not, check discord.

Foundations also contains a lot of useful theoretical information, you might need it.
