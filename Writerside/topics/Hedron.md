# Hedrons

**Maintainer: Interval**

I know there's no TLDR.
That's because all of that has been relegated to Part 1.

## Author's Notes

Using the species is a bit complex, so here's the brief.

You can make any Hedrons you want. But, they must have these in order to be accepted:

* Shell Documentation
* Revision

Here's the full recommended list (not in order):

* Appearance
* Name
* Gas Element
* *List of Deviation from Standards*
* **Revision**
* **Shell Documentation**
* Specialty

## Part 1: The Basics

A hedron is comprised of 4 very important parts:

Shell
: A triangular / polygonal metal* casing, made of various solid elements.
Often can be brittle / very strong, and is very customizable.
They usually have their own characteristics, more on that later.
Most often, when a shell breaks fully, it will detonate.
: They can survive without their shell*, so it's not too bad.

Gas
: Hedrons have an inner gas*, made from Nickel*, and that usually stays there.
Notable, nobody can breathe in the gas, and any offgassing that normally takes place won't occur.
Also, radiation will NOT emit from any gas, unless the Hedron chooses to.
:For a different gas boy, see [Manifold](Manifold.md).

Core
: Hedrons have a core*, which can be either on or off* without them dying.
The only real problems it causes are two: that it could cause Rapid Core Fibrilation (RCF), and nearly triples the chance of instability* in the being.
On the bright side, they get a lot more power behind them.

Components
: The real sauce is the components.
Components can live anywhere on their body, can be just about anything, and when needed to be used; run a cycle.
: `Cycle -> Expand -> Open -> Close -> Contract -> Cycle`

## Part 2: The Mess

### Section 0: Foreword

Hold on, hold on. Before you continue, there are 3 revisions to the Hedron species.
