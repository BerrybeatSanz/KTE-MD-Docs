# Hedrons

**Maintainer: Interval**

I know there's no TLDR.
That's because all of that has been relegated to Part 1.

> You can make any Hedrons you want. But, they must have these in order to be accepted:
> * Shell Documentation
> * Revision

> If you make any significant changes to your Hedron that goes against this page, use a section called *List of Deviations from Standard*.
> Not including it may have your OC rejected.

## Part 1: The Basics

A hedron is comprised of 4 very important parts:

Shell
: A triangular / polygonal metal* casing, made of various solid elements.
Often can be brittle / very strong, and is very customizable.
They usually have their own characteristics, more on that later.
Most often, when a shell breaks fully, it will detonate.
: They can survive without their shell*, so it's not too bad.

Gas
: Hedrons have an inner gas*, made from Nickel*, and that usually stays there.
Notable, nobody can breathe in the gas, and any offgassing that normally takes place won't occur.
Also, radiation will NOT emit from any gas, unless the Hedron chooses to.
:For a different gas boy, see [Manifold](Manifold.md).

Core
: Hedrons have a core*, which can be either on or off* without them dying.
The only real problems it causes are two: that it could cause Rapid Core Fibrilation (RCF), and nearly triples the chance of instability* in the being.
On the bright side, they get a lot more power behind them.

Components
: The real sauce is the components.
Components can live anywhere on their body, can be just about anything, and when needed to be used; run a cycle.
: `Cycle -> Expand -> Open -> Close -> Contract -> Cycle`

## Part 2: The Mess

### Section 0: Foreword

Hold on, hold on. Before you continue, there are 3 revisions to the Hedron species.

<tabs>
<tab id="rev1" title="Revision 1">

> The only Hedron OC I outright forbid is a Revision 1 Hedron.
{style="warning"}

The only revision 1 Hedron is Kepler. Things to note:

* Shell is not made from metal, but some other matte hardened material.
* Has no core
* Has no inner gas

<tab id="rev2" title="Revision 2">

> These are by far the most common - I recommend using this if you want to make one.
