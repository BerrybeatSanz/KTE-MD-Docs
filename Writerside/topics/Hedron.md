# Hedrons

**Maintainer: Interval**

I know there's no TLDR.
That's because all of that has been relegated to Part 1.

> You can make any Hedrons you want. But, they must have these in order to be accepted:
> * Shell Documentation
> * Revision

> If you make any significant changes to your Hedron that goes against this page, include a section called *List of Deviations from Standard*.
Not including it may have your OC rejected.

## Part 1: The Basics

A hedron is comprised of 4 very important parts:

Shell
: A triangular / polygonal metal* casing, made of various solid elements.
Often can be brittle / very strong, and is very customizable.
They usually have their own characteristics, more on that later.
Most often, when a shell breaks fully, it will detonate.
: They can survive without their shell*, so it's not too bad.

Gas
: Hedrons have an inner gas*, made from Nickel*, and that usually stays there.
Notable, nobody can breathe in the gas, and any offgassing that normally takes place won't occur.
Also, radiation will NOT emit from any gas, unless the Hedron chooses to.
:For a different gas boy, see [Manifold](Manifold.md).

Core
: Hedrons have a core*, which can be either on or off* without them dying.
The only real problems it causes are two: that it could cause Rapid Core Fibrilation (RCF), and nearly triples the chance of instability* in the being.
On the bright side, they get a lot more power behind them.

Components
: The real sauce is the components.
Components can live anywhere on their body, can be just about anything, and when needed to be used; run a cycle.
: `Cycle -> Expand -> Open -> Close -> Contract -> Cycle`

## Part 2: The Mess

### Section 0: Foreword

Hold on, hold on. Before you continue, there are 3 revisions to the Hedron species.

<tabs group="revision">
<tab id="rev10" title="Revision 1" group-key="rev1">

> The only Hedron OC I outright forbid is a Revision 1 Hedron.
{style="warning"}

The only revision 1 Hedron is Kepler.
Things to note:

* Shell is not made from metal, but some other matte hardened material.
* Has no core
* Has no inner gas

</tab>
<tab id="rev20" title="Revision 2" group-key="rev2">

> These are by far the most common; use this if you want to make one.
Or don't. I'm not one to stop you.
{style="note"}

Revision 2 Hedrons are standard, by far.
No notable changes, since they *are* the baseline standard.

</tab>
<tab id="rev30" title="Revision 3" group-key="rev3">

> Revision 3 is not fully fleshed out, so anyone can contribute directly to the species' making.
Submit revisions as a PR or DM me on Discord.
{style="note"}

The only current revision 3 Hedron is Raeau, of which I don't even have finished.
Things to note:

* Shell is confined with internal support structures, so gas / shell cannot be separated.
  As a result, the shell is significantly stronger than any other revision's.
* Core cannot be disabled; functions closer to a human heart
* Death occurs when shell is broken.
* Instability does not exist, period.

### Section 1: The Main Four

#### 1.1: Shells

The shell of a Hedron is one of the most important components for its survival.
Each shell is unique, no two are the same.

<tabs group="revision">
<tab id="rev11" title="Revision 1" group-key="rev1">

The shell is not metal on Revision 1, it's instead made of some hardened goo.
What specific kind is unknown.
It's related to whatever is in Dimension 652T, or Kaiju Paradise, however it isn't exact, and does not contain transformative properties.

</tab>
<tab id="rev21" title="Revision 2" group-key="rev2">

Shells have four attributes.

Color
: The color that each triangle will contain.
: Always varies slightly, so any color will be a few moving shades by default.

Filter
: How the color is displayed.
: There are 3 main filters: standard, diffused, and two-tone.
* Standard: Each triangle is the color chosen. Brightness is alterable.
* Diffused: Each triangle is the color chosen, but it appears similar to frosted glass.
* Two-Tone: Only the edges of each triangle has the chosen color, the rest is another optional scale of colors.

Status
: Which orientation the shell is in.
: Two orientations: normal and reversed.
* Normal: weaker against KE, stronger against electricity
* Reversed: rebound electricity, strong against KE

Alterations
: Some change to a shell, altering its properties.
: These alterations are defined per-OC, no actual definitions are here.

</tab>
<tab id="rev31" title="Revision 3" group-key="rev3">

Shells have three attributes.

Color
: The color that each triangle will contain.

Primary Element
: The element that a majority of the shell is made of.
: Determines the primary properties of the shell.

Alterations
: Functionally different from Rev. 2 alterations.
: Add secondary properties to the shell.

> All properties must be defined per-OC, unless there are some universal ones that are commonly used.

</tabs>

#### 1.2: Inner Gas

Inner gas is most commonly nickel, being stored within the Hedron.

<tabs group="revision">
<tab id="rev12" title="Revision 1" group-key="rev1">

Nothing special of note. It's always nickel with no other properties.
</tab>
<tab id="rev22" title="Revision 2" group-key="rev2">

The inner gas is nickel by default.
However, the gasses themselves have 2 main attributes.

Color
: I really should not have to explain this from here on, should I?

Element
: Self-explanatory, the element that the gas is made of.
: The element determines what the gas can do in 3 scenarios:
: * In Isolation
* Combined with Shell
* Leaking from Shell
: Again, must be defined per-OC.
