# Making OCs: Considerations

When creating OCs, there isn't much to talk about in the way of restrictions.
However, courtesy is key and rigidity isn't a great idea, so there's a few things that need to be discussed.

## Introductions

They don't have to be grand, but what they do have to be is *functional*.
While not expressly required in RP depending on how the character's been made, ideally it should be stated by what method the character got there.

## Handling Abilities

It's fine to have a lot of them, and it's fine to be strong.
What isn't okay is something called *unreasonable resistances*.
While functionally, they can exist, it doesn't make sense.

For example, a character primarily dealing with fire shouldn't have a resistance to water,
because it doesn't make sense.

## More?

This is much less a rigid article; if I have more to ramble about, I will.
