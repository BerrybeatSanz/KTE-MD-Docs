# Foundations

This is all of the preliminary / really really boring information that sometimes you have to read, sometimes you don't.
It's entirely your choice if you want to read this, but you may want to give it a skim to understand some things.

Pay attention to the category names, maintainers, and especially the author's notes.
They dictate how, when, and what you can use something for.

> It is recommended that you start with Dimension Theory and Dimensional Limits.
They give you the background of a lot of this server's ruling and formatting for channels and in-RP etiquette.

> An author note will usually be this
{style="note"}

> or this
{style="warning"}

Look out for these notes, they appear every so often and are sometimes critical to understanding a topic or usage cases.

## Other Things

If you want to make changes, go ahead!
This is a public GitHub repository, go on and clone it and do whatever.
Do note that this is Markdown and a dash of Semantic Markup, so go to the
[Jetbrains Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/writerside/discover-writerside.html)
documentation for all of the specifics.

> You don't need Writerside to make edits, mostly because it's free now, but will be paid after it's done being in its Early Access Program stage.
Use any editor that supports markdown that you like, just note that previews won't work as good as they usually do.
