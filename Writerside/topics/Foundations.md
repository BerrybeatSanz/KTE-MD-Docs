# Foundations

Welcome, all you new people or people who need a refresher.
This is the foundations section, a place to read and learn the ins-and-outs of KTE.

## For the new people

Articles are meant to be read in order, from top to bottom.
The purpose is solely to provide information; more complex topics have their own sections involved.
I recommend you start with the Introduction section.

## For the people who've already been here

Pick a section, find what you need to brush up on, and skim / read it.
By the time everything's ready, it should all be here.

## Notes

> This style is for anything technical, like math or overly complex topics.

> These are for important considerations, that the reader should know.

> These are things that shouldn't be broken, such as rules.
Or, common mistakes.
