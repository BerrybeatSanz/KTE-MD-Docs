# What if there's more than two people?

I'm glad you thought of that.

Turn-based combat relies heavily on one-on-one conflicts.
But, some OCs may function better as supports, so what happens?

If you can consider the third person to be a major part of the fight, then it turn into an Uneven battle, where it's something like 2-on-1, or 3-on-2.
However, 2v2 and 3v3 fall under Partner Battles, which work a different way.
If, however, it's something like 4v30, that's a Horde Battle which *doesn't* use a turn-based system at all.
The final classification is more than two parties, which is a Cutthroat Battle, which also doesn't use a turn-based system, yet.


## Partner Battles
For partner battles, striking does not determine order.
Instead, the turn order is decided by the speed of the people involved, which means it might bounce back and forth between the sides.
