# Nuclide: Bulwark

This is a form of Nuclide's, which deliberately changes how he supports others.
Triggered from the "Expanded Tungsten Backup Reaction".

## Outside Changes
The main change is obvious - instead of lighter PPE, he's now covered, head to toe, in half a metric ton of dense tungsten sealed armor.
It is specifically rated to tank a lot more, however it comes at many costs.
The better side of things, it's toggleable at any time but with a cooldown of 2 cycles.

## Passive Changes

* Static 20% damage reduction to all physical / ballistic damage, 10% to anything magic-related.
* Halves movement speed.
* Automatically gives **Slow** every 3 cycles it is active.

## Weapon Changes
Nearly all of his weapons are different in at least some way.

### Primary Weapons
On his back is an expandable Heavy Ballistic Cover, the modified version of his original collapsible riot shield.
Now much heavier, it can set into the ground with cleat-like spikes to stay implanted straight up.
No longer can collapse nearly as far.
It also does not collapse to weak-mid strength magic, will only break to physical, strong ballistic, and strong magic.
Much more intended for not himself, but for others.

He also loses his sledgehammer entirely.
Mostly because it wouldn't do much.
Also because of balancing.

### Secondary Weapons
He now carries two different secondaries, one mounted to his chest and the other at his waist.
One is a GPMG-7 with a crossbar, the other is a Model 680, seen below.

Details:

* The GPMG-7 is meant for medium range open applications, sending about 900 RPM downrange, with five magazines totalling 875 rounds.
* The Model 860 is meant for close-range, with a modified 6 round magazine containing DB-FMJ rounds, applying **Burning** for one cycle to anyone hit.
Six magazines totalling 36 rounds.
