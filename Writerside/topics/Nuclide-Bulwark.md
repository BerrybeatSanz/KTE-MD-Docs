# Nuclide: Bulwark

**"None of you are dying."**

## Overview

This is a form of Nuclide's, which deliberately changes how he supports others.
Triggered from the "Expanded Tungsten Backup Reaction".

## Outside Changes
The main change is obvious - instead of lighter PPE, he's now covered, head to toe, in half a metric ton of dense tungsten sealed armor.
It is specifically rated to tank a lot more, however it comes at many costs.
The better side of things, it's toggleable at any time but with a cooldown of 2 cycles.

## Passive Changes

* Static incoming 20% damage reduction to all physical / ballistic damage, 10% to anything magic-related.
* Halves movement speed.
* Automatically gives **Slow** every 3 cycles it is active.

## Weapon Changes
Nearly all of his weapons are different in at least some way.

### Primary Weapons
On his back is an expandable Heavy Ballistic Cover, the modified version of his original collapsible riot shield.
Now much heavier, it can set into the ground with cleat-like spikes to stay implanted straight up.
No longer can collapse nearly as far.
It also does not collapse to weak-mid strength magic, will only break to physical, strong ballistic, and strong magic.
Much more intended for not himself, but for others.

He also loses his sledgehammer entirely.
Mostly because it wouldn't do much.
Also because of balancing.

### Secondary Weapons
He now carries two different secondaries, one mounted to his chest and the other at his waist.
One is a FiNN LMG, the other is a Model 680, seen below.

Details:

* The FiNN LMG is running a much higher fire rate, and is built like this specifically for ease of use.
The lightweight construction allows for other people to use it without much trouble, even with 100 rounds with 10 magazines total.
Not to mention it uses Cased Telescoped rounds, which means it moves even quicker.
* The Model 860 is meant for close-range, with a modified 6 round magazine containing DB-FMJ rounds, applying **Burning** for one cycle to anyone hit.
Six magazines totalling 36 rounds.
