# Dimension Theory

<tldr>
A dimension is an area of space surrounded by a kind of barrier. Originally spheres, now they're much more abstract shapes that fit into eachother, or spread apart.

## The What

There are 3 meanings to the word "Dimension". All of them are equally as important (except the 2nd one), so they're at least good to know.

Spatial Dimensions
: These are the 2D, 3D, and all of that you're probably used to. Most commonly laid out in a coordinate system too. This will be important with [hypercomplex space](HypCom.md).

Temporal Dimensions
: This is the whole "oh the 4th dimension is time" kind of thing.
I don't have a good source for this, this is just here so people don't get mad.

Aerial Dimensions
: Yes, a made up word, I know.
: Aerial Dimensions are what this page is about, and see the TLDR for the summary on what they are.
I might write something much lengthier here, but I don't feel like it as of 12/11/2024 (MM.DD.YYYY).

## Dimension Format

`Dimension X-AO`

Listed here are what the letters mean.

#### X

`X` is the dimension's [ODR](ODR.md) number, which usually isn't important except for a few notable ones. Each dimension also has a multiverse attached to it, more on that later.

###### The notable ones.

<tabs group="omniverse">
<tab id="t1" title="TFCT" group-key="tfct">

{type="compact"}0T
: "Center Point", home to Khazingrad and Kingdom `link needed`.

1T
: Earth

532T
: Undertale

652T
: Kaiju Paradise

22493T
: The dimension that's home to IADR

</tab>
<tab id="e1" title="EOT" group-key="eot">

{type="compact"}0E
: EOT ver. of "Center Point"

3E
: Arborwood, home to a seemingly unending orange forest.

</tab>
</tabs>

#### A

`A` is the dimension's Alternate Universe (AU) Identification (ID), or `AUID`.
Do note that AUs and Dimensions are not equal.

AU
: A variation on a dimension. For example, `Dimension 532T` is Undertale, but `Dimension 532-1T` is Alpha!Tale.
: The `!` is the indicator of most AUs.

#### O

`O` is the identifier of which Omniverse it is a part of.

Omniverse
: A very large area, only two are known, which are TFCT (T) and EOT (E).

## All the Terms

There's a sort of hierarchy to dimensions, it goes like this:

* Omniverses contain Hyperverses (H)
* Hyperverses contain Multiverses (MV)
* Multiverses contain AUs and Mainlines (AUID of 0)

The prior notation is only applicable in Hyperverse 0 of either omniverse.

## OC Jank

OCs can differ across AUIDs, the biggest example is "Sans", of which each AU of MV-532 has their own version of it, some already presented before.
These variations are referred to as Skews, of which follow the form of
`SkewName!OriginalName(AUID)`, so Mirror, Nuclide's Skew 37, his full name would be `Mirror!Nuclide(37)`.
