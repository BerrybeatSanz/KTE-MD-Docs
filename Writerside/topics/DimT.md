# Dimension Theory

**Maintainer: Interval**

<tldr>
Dimensions are often a term thrown around, of which might be obvious, but a rigorous definition is still good to have.
Essentially, a dimension is an area of space surrounded by a kind of barrier. Originally spheres, now they're much more abstract shapes that fit into eachother, or spread apart.

## The What

There are 3 meanings to the word "Dimension". All of them are equally as important (except the 2nd one), so they're at least good to know.

Spatial Dimensions
: These are the 2D, 3D, and all of that you're probably used to. Most commonly laid out in a coordinate system too. This will be important with [hypercomplex space]().

Temporal Dimensions
: This is the whole "oh the 4th dimension is time" kind of thing.
I don't have a good source for this, this is just here so people don't get mad.

Aerial Dimensions
: Yes, a made up word, I know.
: Aerial Dimensions are what this page is about, and see the TLDR for the summary on what they are.
I might write something much lengthier here, but I don't feel like it as of 12/11/2024 (MM.DD.YYYY).

## Format

`Dimension X-A of O`

Listed here are what the letters mean.

#### X

`X` is the dimension's [ODR](ODR.md) number, which usually isn't important except for a few notable ones.
