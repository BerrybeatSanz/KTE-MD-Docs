# Dimension Theory

<tldr>
A dimension is an area of space surrounded by a kind of barrier. Originally spheres, now they're much more abstract shapes that fit into eachother, or spread apart.

## The What

There are 3 meanings to the word "Dimension". All of them are equally as important (except the 2nd one), so they're at least good to know.

Spatial Dimensions
: These are the 2D, 3D, and all of that you're probably used to. Most commonly laid out in a coordinate system too. This will be important with [hypercomplex space](HypCom.md).

Temporal Dimensions
: This is the whole "oh the 4th dimension is time" kind of thing.
I don't have a good source for this, this is just here so people don't get mad.

Aerial Dimensions
: Yes, a made up word, I know.
: Aerial Dimensions are what this page is about, and see the TLDR for the summary on what they are.
I might write something much lengthier here, but I don't feel like it as of 12/11/2024 (MM.DD.YYYY).

## Dimension Format

`Dimension X-AO`

Listed here are what the letters mean.

#### X

`X` is the dimension's [ODR](ODR.md) number, which usually isn't important except for a few notable ones. Each dimension also has a multiverse attached to it, more on that later.

###### The notable ones.

#### A

`A` is the dimension's Alternate Universe (AU) Identification (ID), or `AUID`.
Do note that AUs and Dimensions are not equal.

AU
: A variation on a dimension. For example, `Dimension 532T` is Undertale, but `Dimension 532-1T` is Alpha!Tale.
: The `!` is the indicator of most AUs.
