# Dimensional Limits

<tldr>

**Maintainer: Interval**

Limit 1 states that nothing is ever static.

Limit 2 states that every normal entity in existence has exactly 2 counterparts.

There are currently two dimensional limits.
Each one is a rule that cannot be broken, except for any listed exceptions, of which there are few.

> Moderators will be watching for these, so be careful with your wording and OCs.

Limit 1 is the law that everything is ever-changing, and that nothing is truly an absolute.
That is to say, nothing can be immortal, or nothing can be unbreakable, as there is always a method to bypass anything.
Granted, some things may be extremely difficult.
If something is unbreakable now, there is no guarantee it will be unbreakable later, as one of the many methods abiding by Limit 1 is time.

There are only 2 exceptions to Limit 1.
Limits and the ODR.

For the Limits to hold their own, they must be an exception to themselves.
This means that the Limits themselves cannot be broken, when everything else can be.

The [ODR](ODR.md) isn't actually a tangible thing, it's in some undefined location.
However, since it both does and doesn't exist, and since it's the backend to [HWMD](Format.md), it's kept in as an exception.
The ODR may be *unreachable*, however the concept itself cannot be erased.

<tab id="l2" title="Limit 2">

Limit 2 is the law that every single normally defined entity will have exactly two counterparts.

One counterpart is the Hypercomplex counterpart, denoted by `δ` in front of the entity's name.
The counterpart exclusively exists within [](HypCom.md).

> When an OC swaps to Hypercomplex Space, all they're doing is shifting the battlefield into the space, and handing everything over to the respective counterparts.
Counterparts will always retain the knowledge of eachother, yet can have their own behaviors and abilities.

>Do note that upon a switch, the two counterparts that swapped will have their health, stamina, and other gauges averaged between them.
This is something to pay attention to when fighting across multiple spaces.
{style="warning"}

The second counterpart is the [Alterworld](AltW.md) counterpart, denoted by `φ` in front of the entity's name.

If any counterpart dies, all 3 dies.
There is a convenience; all 3 would have to be in the same situation for this to realistically occur. If the δ counterpart is fighting, so is the regular one, and so is the φ counterpart.
