# Nuclide

**"Support is on standby. Your call."**

## Overview

Nuclide is a Manifold, standing at 5'11", made from Darmsdadtium-237.
He often wears full-body white and teal PPE, including full-face respirator, to block 99.95% of radiation output.

Carrying a large white combat bag, there's a decent chance he's got the right thing for some situation.
He's a support OC, preferring to not fight on his own but rather assist others who he deems "fighting for a good reason".

## Weapons

He carries around two sets of weapons, primaries and secondaries.
His primary set is visible at all times, his secondary set is in his large combat bag.

### Primaries

On his back, under his bag, is a seemingly long stick of sorts.
This is a deployable riot shield, which will be more important in his abilities section.
For now, it acts, obviously, as a shield, to which can withstand a few physical hits before automatically contracting and on a cooldown of 2 cycles before re-deployment.
Upon forced closure, it emits a pulse, knocking very close entities back about maybe 5 feet, just enough to get him out of there and repositioned.

His second primary he usually carries around, and it's his sledgehammer.
Made of condensed tungsten, there's a prying end at the bottom of the handle, and the hammer head itself contains a blunt and sharp edge, on opposite sides.
Often, in the wild, he's cleaning / polishing it, because it shines really well when it's clean.

### Secondaries

If he ever needs range, he has two secondaries, an AS VAL and X16.
They are both pictured below.

Details:

* The AS VAL is meant for long range, having been converted to semi-auto in favor of higher armor piercing.
The official caliber change is 5.45x39mm -> 9x39mm SPP.
* He carries 6 magazines + 1 in the gun for the AS VAL, 70 total rounds by default.
* He also carries 3 magazines + 1 in the gun for the X16, 52 total rounds by default.

## Abilities

Abilities for Nuclide are in 3 different sections: specialties, equipment, and reactives.
This usually goes for all of my OCs, so keep an eye.

<tabs>

<tab id="special" title="Specialties">

These are the equivalent of what others consider "abilities", just as their own category.

Guard
: If possible, blocks with his arms.
Reduces incoming physical damage for at most 2 attacks per defense by 10%.

Shieldguard
: Rapidly deploys his shield to counter an enemy.
Has a 50% chance of succeding, blocking 30% of damage and rebounding 5%, but instantly collapsing the shield, starting the cooldown +1 cycle added on; the other 50% is to recoil and give Nuclide *Dizzy*.

Radioactive Discharge
: After 2 cycles of deliberately building up energy, he can release it all through a valve on his arm, targeting the enemy team.
Gives 3 cycles of Irradiated to all entities in range (20 feet, $\frac{\pi}{4}$ radian flat forward), friendly or not.

Expanded Tungsten Backup Reaction (ETBR)
: Triggers the "Bulwark" form.
See [](Nuclide-Bulwark.md).
Can also be used to exit the form.

Borrow
: Allows him to reach into a portal, grabbing the gear from any of the following list:
: Isa
: Mirror
: Eiro
: All of the gear will have significant changes made to them, each of which will have their changes listed on 

</tab>

<tab id="equip" title="Equipment">

These are what some would consider "perks", but are also his utility items.

**Gear**

Light Gloves
: Reloads quicker.
LMGs are still an open line, but most other weapons will reload faster and leave much less time for the enemy to take advantage of.

Pressure Plates
: Gives the PPE suit a lot of direct blunt damage resistance, before needing to replace the plates.
Only from the front, and only at the torso.

Adaptive Nozzle
: The left side of his respirator has a quick-release nozzle for any tank to slip into.
Applicable to Inhaled Accelerant Canisters, or some other gas if he ever gets any.

**Utility Items**

Inhaled Accelerant Canisters
: Once inserted into the nozzle and activated, gives him a 2 cycle High, and a 3 cycle Crash afterward.

Rejack Stim
: Can be used to give stamina to a person who was previously incapacitated.
Does not work on dead people.
Must be held for 2 consecutive cycles to bring them back, more can be done to increase potency.
Usually only used when extraction is necessary.
Can be performed once per person downed.
: When used on himself, however, it increases his speed 3-fold and gives **Fast** for 5 cycles, but also immediately gives **Rapid Decay I**.
Used immediately, only once per fight.

</tab>
<tab id="react" title="Reactives">

Reactives are never abilities that Nuclide can trigger, only ones that are automatically activated.

Suit Pressure Fault
: Occurs when the PPE sustains a major hole.
Minor slits or punctures won't cause this.
Causes 5 cycles of Irradiated to be applied to all participants of the battle, and 4 Decay to Nuclide.
In a 10 foot radius, Irradiated counts up instead of down until the suit is fixed.

DBNO
: Whenever Nuclide sustains enough damage, he falls backward and braces forward.
In this state, he has his X16 but *cannot reload without assistance* and can be picked up by a teammate, all the while he himself is mostly incapacitated, only being able to shift with his legs.
