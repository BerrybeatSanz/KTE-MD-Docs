# Nuclide

<primary-label ref="impart"/>
<secondary-label ref="rework"/>

## Metadata {collapsible=true}

* Species: [Gas-Based Entity, Type 2 (Manifold)](Gas-Based-Entities.md)
* Derived from [](Integrand.md)

## Overview {switcher-key="Regular"}

Nuclide is a Type 2 Manifold, being made of stabilized Darmsdadtium-237.
He stands at a reasonable 5 feet and 10 inches, which while significantly shorter than most, isn't all bad.
His versatility is unmatched, and willingness to think up whatever he can on the spot serves him well.

### Appearance

He will always be seen wearing two things of note.

The first of which is full-body Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), which is a four-layer suit.
* Layer 1: Augmented White Nomex IIIA. Augment: Enhanced Chemical Protection. Provides heavy Flame Protection, near perfect air-tight seal.
* Layer 2: 50% Standard Modacrylic & 50% Standard Tyvek. Less fire-resistant, but a bit more radiation protection and very good rip / tear protection.
* Layer 3: 100% Flexible Lead. Best in the business so far for radiation protection.
* Layer 4: 100% Cotton. Meant exclusively for comfort.

All materials should be interpreted as being stronger than normally seen, as he needs to still be able to stack up with stronger beings, especially so the suit doesn't tear.

The second item is a gas mask, bolted to the PPE, covering his face in its entirety.
On the very front there exists a respiration module, all it does is clean the air that comes in and blocks radiation from leaving through it.
The left side has a very useful quick-release port, used to eat / drink through a detachable hose he carries.
This port also is assumed to have radiation protection.
The final module is another valve, one that is significantly more secure and is threaded, used for Inhalants.
The mask itself is made from Lead as well, as to continue radiation blocking.

* Net effect: 98.3% Radiation Interception.
* Colors: White (Primary), Teal (Secondary).

Continued, he has some other things.
Namely, a combat bag which he stows a lot of his things in, secured and detachable onto the back of his PPE.

Along with all of this gear, it is possible for him to wear clothing over the PPE if need be, although that is very rare.

### Personality

He's a very quiet guy, preferring to not talk to people he doesn't know or that aren't clients.
Working in the defense research sector has taught him a lot, one of which is to only say what's necessary.
Not to mention, his mask makes it harder to hear him without a direct line of communication such as a radio, so if he's talking, it's most likely through a radio.

Despite his seemingly reserved nature, he listens very well and acts as a decent support figure if needed.
While he may not be the best, and he seems almost *half-finished*, Nuclide is well-rounded in his ways, being very polite whenever he is called upon or is speaking.

## Weapons {switcher-key="Regular"}

Nuclide, being the versatile man he is, carries three sets of weaponry on him at all times.

### Sledgehammer (Offense, Primary)

His sledgehammer is made in its entirety, handle and all, from 100% tungsten metal, polished.
It has 3 ends: a flat and sharp end on opposing side of the head, and a prying end on the handle.
The sledgehammer in total is 8 feet long, but the handle makes up most of that distance.

#### Thermite Spike

Exiting the flat end is a square-pyramid shaped spike, with 6 circles machined through it.
When pushed against an object, the top layer of the spike pushes back into the hammer to do a few things.

1. The pushback strikes a pin, igniting a sparkler by using similar mechanisms to a bullet.
2. The sparkler goes into a charge of thermite that is at the core of the spike, as well as in the channels.
3. By the time the top layer is pushed fully back, the channels are open and the thermite in them is ignited, sending out molten iron and extreme heat.

This also works when swung into an enemy, the spike being some variation of armor piercing.

Cooldown of 3 cycles, since the spikes must be replaced and armed.

### Ballistic Riot Shield (Defense, Primary)

It's a standard riot shield, with a few notable changes.

First, it's retractable, such that in its compressed state it looks more like a metal stick rather than a shield.
There exist LEDs on the ends of the stick / shield, green when expandable and red when on cooldown.

Second, it can only take so much damage before automatically retracting.
This is done for balance's sake, as opposed to realism.
The shield, when automatically retracted due to natural incoming damage, takes 2 cycles to recharge.

Third, all damage inflicted to the shield is sent to Nuclide at a 20% reduction.

#### Special Guard

When timed correctly, the perfect expansion of the shield can rebound attacks.
This immediately gives a 60% damage reduction for the attack that just hit, and rebounds 40% of incoming damage to the attacker.
The shield, however, immediately retracts and the same recharge time as natural damage is applied.
