## Overview

Nick is a half-machine, but this machine isn't robotic.
Instead, his whole body is made up of clock parts.
They act as his bones, his muscles, with only some of his humanity remaining in his hands and head.

If these parts stop working, especially the clock in the center of his chest, then he'll die.
These parts are routinely replaced to maintain almost-immortality.

## Appearance

He doesn't like the robotic evolution of his species; he still uses their technology.
This leads to a wired tail extending from his spinal column, ending in a sharp blade.
Technology such as the finned headset are an artifact of this as well.

As for his clothes, he usually sticks to traditional brown and yellow.
There exists a mix of fabric and semi-armor.

He has detachable wings and goggles for flying, however the goggles possess extra technological capabilities.
The goggles specifically can also read and store information about what he sees.
