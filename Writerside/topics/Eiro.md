*"Let's see what's going on here..."*

## Metadata {collapsible=true}

* Species: [Gas-Based Entity, Type 2 (Hedron)](Gas-Based-Entities.md)

## Overview

Eiro is a Type 1 Manifold, standing at 6 feet and 7 inches.
While not the tallest by any means, he stands out as a very weird case, not being like the others of IDARC.
He's the best in the business for anything recon-related, and you'll soon learn to appreciate his help.

### Hedral Information

Shell
: Normal, Dark Green, Extra-Hardened Magnesium Steel

Gas
: Nickel, Light Blue

Agnostic Core
: Somehow bridges the gap between HWMD and MCS.

## Appearance

He consistently wears a pair of blue, kept jeans, a short-sleeve black shirt, and a pair of over-ear closed-back wireless headphones around his neck, containing a microphone embedded within; he keeps things simple.
On his face is a nanite faceplate; the same material that protogens use as their visor material.
This came about as a hackjob fix to repair a part of his burned head, turns out he likes how it functions.

### Faceplate

Most Hedrons display a set of eyes and a mouth, that are tangible.
Eiro, however, does not do this; instead placing a yellow waveform in the middle of his faceplate.

This waveform will not only move when he talks, but also conveys emotion.
It also distorts his voice slightly, making it sound almost filtered or a tinge robotic.
Fitting, considering his affinity with technology and backend work.

## Personality

Commonly energetic, he's ready to do just about anything with light convincing.
May be seen as non-serious, and that's just the truth; he's a nice guy, but a bit too light at time.
For a Hedron, he's surprisingly thorough though, and even if he can jump the gun sometimes, he's always methodical with how he does it.

However, when battling, it seems as though there is a dichotomy; the energy leaves entirely, leaving the much more logical side exposed.
This does not imply less emotion, rather his actions will change.

> Below, are two sections, and you are free to look at what you want.

## Reconnaissance Set {collapsible=true}

He can act as a recon man, call him up whenever you need.
The details of what he does and the process is simple.

He begins by getting set up.
If he's doing it in a place he's familiar with, setup is ignored.
If not, or if there's other barriers, there will be a 3 Cycle startup time, where no requests can be made.

> Only one action can be done at once.
His abilities require some strategy to use effectively.
{style=note}

After getting set up, whoever called him in (or team, that works too) can call in certain actions.
More details are outlined below.

### Alignment Brief

I should elaborate on who exactly he wants to help.
If someone is close enough to his morals (i.e. generally considered to be positive / neutral), he'll help so long as he isn't busy with anything.

If a Hedron is requesting his help, he'll help unconditionally.
However, if the said Hedron happens to have morals he doesn't agree with, he'll be one cycle slower on his actions, deliberately dragging his ass.

On another note, call-ins are possible.
If someone (who isn't a Hedron) has morals he doesn't agree with, BUT a Hedron gives a good reason, he'll also begrudgingly assist, again with a one cycle penalty.
These do stack; a non-aligning Hedron calling in a non-aligning non-Hedron as a vouch will incur a two cycle penalty on EVERYTHING.

He's a petty bastard, some days.

### Fast Setup

If the case is where the requester is in reasonable danger of death, and Eiro is just called in, he can expedite the process of setup if need be.
It depends on the barriers of the area if he can get setup done in 1, 2, or 3 cycles.

### Shutdown Clause

If the area contains a certain type of blocking, or such that the blockage is too powerful, Eiro won't be able to assist in recon.
However, he can still be called in to do battle as a support.

### Ability: Modifier / Attribute Lookup

Using his knowledge of the ODR, he will pull either a weakness or a resistance from the targeted enemy.

* Can only be used on one target, OR a horde (if horde battle applies)
* Will only fetch one item per use, can either be a weakness or a resistance
* Can be repeated
* Takes 3 Cycles by default to receive the data

If no data exists, then he will only take 1 cycle to realize that there's nothing, and give up.

### Ability: Scan

If invisible or hidden enemies are present, he can find them for the requester.

* Only usable when invisible enemies are suspected; not always known if there are or aren't.
If it can be confirmed, then he'll open the option.
* Can only go through if the enemy stays invisible / hidden for the *entire* duration.
If they become visible, the action will stop scanning, but the full time will still be used up.
* Takes 3 Cycles by default to find the hiding enemy.

### Ability: Care Package

He'll send in something by portal to assist the requester.

* Individual requests can be made; time depends on what was asked and how much
* The size of the package determines how easy it is to intercept
* 6 Cycle cooldown between delivery and next ask

### Ability: Hands-On Support

> Will immediately disengage reconnaissance.
Any actions in progress will be cancelled and no benefit will be attained.
{style=warning}

Upon the requester's ask, he will get out of his seat and get out there.

* Requires the requester to be on good terms with him OR a Hedron in danger.
Vouching will not work for this one.
* All of his abilities will be that of his battle set.

## Battle Set {collapsible=true}

### Weapon: Experimental LAR ("Big Boy")

A fictional Lever Action rifle based on the S&W 1854 Series (45-70 Govt).
While made to retain its look (excluding size), it's made from much higher strength materials, and the caliber is different.
I need to mention, though, that the rifle is very big.


![](14204-sw-rifle-OnWhite-Right__45741.png)

* Caliber: 33x240mm Corrosive
  * Corrosive: 15% chance to apply Decay to a hit target for 3 cycles. Does not stack.
* Tube Capacity: 3 rounds (+chamber: 4)
* Can only fire once per cycle; the rounds are big, and so is the gun.
* Takes 2 cycles always to reload and 3 from empty.

### Abilities

He primarily deals with nanites as a useful tool, residing within his body.
All of these imply he has his shell, if not stated otherwise.

: Within a short range, he can overload the enemy with information.
: Inflicts **Confusion** for 3 Cycles, takes 2 to properly set up.
If blocked, does not inflict.

<tab id="force" title="Auto-Activated / Passive">

Detonate (Shell-Independent)
: If his shell becomes too damaged, it detonates in a medium radius around him, breaking the shell.
: Removes use of his shell-focused abilities; grants use of his gas abilities.

Logicality
: A property of his, granting him faster reaction time for attacks he knows in and out.

<tab id="core" title="Core-Specific">

SSH In
: Allows him to functionally change his format from HWMD (Halfway Metadata Database) to MCS (Mainframe Code System).

Exit
: Allows him to functionally change his format from MCS to HWMD.

Tether (Core-Dependent)
: He attaches his nanites to something, and then he parses specific information.
: Allows him to deescalate situations, or examine beings of HWMD or MCS depending if the core's state matches the being he is attempting to examine.

Assembly (MCS)
