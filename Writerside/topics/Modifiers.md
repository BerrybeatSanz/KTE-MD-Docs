# Statuses, Modifiers, and Math (oh no)

## Status: Abstract

A "status" is just something afflicting an entity, whether good or bad.
Many of them exist to hurt, though.

Most commonly, they appear as a random chance from an ability or something else.
For example, I was hoping to have Clef's bugle give somewhere in the ballpark of a 30% chance to give Confusion to any enemy, it runs the chance for every enemy.

yeah i'll finish the statuses later

## Modifiers
There are 3 kinds of modifiers: cycle, chance to apply, and chance to trigger.
For example, if a move has a 40% chance to apply 3 turns of Confusion:
* A -2 cycle modifier means it will only apply for 1 cycle
* A +10% apply chance would make it 50%
* A -5% trigger chance would make it 10% to trigger

these are useful as advanced weaknesses / resistances
like a character weak to electricity could also have a +1 cycle on zap (which isn't paralysis) or something

or someone more mentally resilient could be -5% trigger on both confusion and dizzy

honestly i'll expand it if it's got good reception
