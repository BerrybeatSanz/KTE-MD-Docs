# Extra Situations

As with anything with this server, nothing is ever that easy.
No situation will always be one-on-one, and as such, there's a few considerations to be made for each.

Since all of the changes will be pretty long, there will be a switcher at the top right.
This is to change exactly what situation is being shown; these may appear later.

## Partner Battles {switcher-key="Partner"}

Partner battles are the simplest of the new kinds; more than two people, and more than one per team.
An example is a one-on-two or a two-on-two.

### Who goes first?

As a recap to 1v1s, it's the person who:
* Lands a First Strike
* Higher Speed
* Gentleman Agreed

However, partners work a little different.
Partner battles will NEVER use the Normal form of combat, always Lenient.
This is because more free-form combat is much more required with more than two people involved; trying to structure an entire speed-based turn order system is not in the spirit of this server.

### Carry

Carry is a special mechanic. 

It essentially is an automatically activated ability that all characters have, if they are within a partner battle and have a partner on their side.

This will only activate when the teammate is in an *out* state, not a *down* state.
Most characters do not have a down state, but all have an out state.

For example, if Nuclide goes DBNO, then he will NOT be carried; as he can still have himself or his teammate get himself up.

Carry isn't the only auto-activation, as it's the default.
If you want to specify one for your own OC, such that it replaces Carry, then that is entirely fine.
Do note that it, again, automatically activates.
And it is to not be taken advantage of; you don't have to message about it, it's easier that way.

## Cutthroat Battles {switcher-key="Cutthroat"}

So, there isn't a system.
This follows just the Lenient system with a few more tweaks.

Whoever goes first is not rigorous.
It just happens.

Music be damned, I'm not figuring it out across 3 or more different teams.

## Horde Battles {switcher-key="Horde"}

Horde battles are a special case, as they do not function on a turn-based system at all.
Instead, it is a continuous flow of action/reaction, and Cycle / Turn cooldowns are replaced with Kill Count cooldowns.

The definition of a horde battle is that a set of people are up against a significantly larger group, at least 9:1, and they must NOT be considered formal OCs, or ones that are conventionally "important".
For example, 3 people taking on a militia of 40 is considered a horde battle, as that militia in of itself is not an OC; it's most likely a faction.

## What now?

Not quite sure.
These battles are much rarer, and designing a system around them is going to take me a while, and isn't on my list.
