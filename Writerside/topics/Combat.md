# Combat

Combat is supposedly the heart of TFCT, and that rings true for much of its lifespan.
While this sort of area has been a little barren, things are picking back up, warranting this article.

Combat is primarily performed using a turn-based system, except it's much more complicated than that.
Each little aspect has been tuned to be as hopefully interesting as possible, with more developments always on the way.
